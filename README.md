# weather data pipelines

Real-time data pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze weather data from OpenWeatherMap.

Very heavily a work in progress, as this is something that I started doing but didn't ever finish and I plan on picking this up again soon.

# technologies used

* Apache Kafka for data ingestion (running as a Python script)
* pySpark for stream data processing
* HDFS + Hive for data storage
* Python
